 *  \brief ICSS-EMAC LLD version information.
 *
 *  Version encoding: 32-bit value MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD
 *
 *  When to increment each component:
 *    MAJOR - EMAC LLD redesign or drop-in support removal (API break).
 *            Example: 01.00.00.00 -> 02.00.00.00
 *    MINOR - Introduction of a new protocol or feature that does not break
 *            any existing functionality.
 *            Example: 01.03.00.00 -> 01.04.00.00
 *    PATCH - Targeted bug-fix release; no new APIs or features added.
 *            Example: 01.04.00.00 -> 01.04.01.00
 *    BUILD - Auto-incremented identifier for every internal CI/CD build.
 *            Example: 01.04.01.00 -> 01.04.01.01
